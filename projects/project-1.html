			<h3>Podworking Landing Page</h3>
			<p>This was a project I worked on whilst working as an intern at Grand Creative. This was for a client, who is developing a website called Podworking. I was responsible for creating the static landing page, copying from a photoshop document. This meant translating an iamge into an interactive website. For this I used skills in HTML and CSS as well as a CSS plugin known as Bootstrap. 			</p>
