			<h3>SOBA - Video</h3>
			<p>This is a project I have recently completed in my physical computing class. I made the entire thing using arduino and other components. The idea is that it is a breath activated bottle opener. the device reads the amount of alcohol in a user's breath then determines whether they are sober enough to open a bottle or not. If the user blows over the value of 450, thenn the bottle opener wont work. This is the video of my final product </p>
