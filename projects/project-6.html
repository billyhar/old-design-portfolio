			<h3>Ups and Downs - An Exploration of Emotion</h3>
			<p>This was a web based project, Which I recently did for university. It is a web comic, taking a trip of the emotions in s relationship. All the designs in this project were made by me in Illustrator and Photoshop. All the code was also done by me. The languages involved are HTML CSS and jQuery. I used jQuery to make a parralax scroll motion between sections of the web comic. There are also other features such as smooth scroll and icon animations. You can view a live demo of this project by clicking the button below. </p>
