			<h3>OBC - Our Backyard Collection</h3>
			<p>This is a project I have completed for a client, looking to extend his business. I designed the logo using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. The task was to design a new logo for a new section of the business. The section focussed around domestic tourism in New Zealand. It's name is Our Backyard Collection. This logo is now being used on many promotional material such as tea-towels, aprons and on the clients website. </p>
